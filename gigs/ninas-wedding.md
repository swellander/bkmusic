description: >-
  Christian Sands is an emerging jazz force. He possesses pianistic technique in
  abundance, but it perfectly matches his conception. His use of understatement
  accomplishes a much deeper musical goal. He takes a fresh look at the entire
  language of jazz: stride, swing, bebop, progressive, fusion, Brazilian and
  Afro-Cuban. He says, â€œMy music is about teaching the way of jazz and keeping
  it alive. Born May 22, 1989, Christian possessed an insatiable appetite for
  music. He was enrolled in music classes at age 4 and wrote his first
  composition at age 5. He received his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Manhattan
  School of Music.
